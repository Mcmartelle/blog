# Utility Lanyard

How to make a lanyard with a finger loop and a wrist loop that can be easily attached and detached from things.

1. Cut a string to 32 inches (this fits my wide hands, 36 inches is good if you like puns)

2. Fold in half and tie a [figure-8 knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) with both sides near the end.

3. Tie another figure-8 knot and adjust it so you can comfortably fit a finger through it.

4. Tie a third figure-8 knot and adjust it so your hand can just get through.

5. Tie to item with a [cow hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/cow-hitch-knot-loops-method). That's it!

When the lanyard is around your wrist it shouldn't fall off on accident.
